My name is Ben Styles. I currently make eBooks for the UK's leading publisher of poetry in translation, [Arc Publications](http://arcpublications.co.uk/). Initially employed as Editorial Assistant, I initiated the company's move into digital publishing.

My background is in languages and literature, giving me extensive experience in successful communication. I have a degree in English and Spanish and an MA in English Literature, both from the University of Leeds.

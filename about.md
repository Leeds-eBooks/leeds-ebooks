![Ben Styles](/images/mugshot.jpg){: .mugshot}My name is Ben Styles. I make apps and websites, publish poetry in translation, and play violin.

I spent my early life in Madrid and Buckinghamshire. I received a BA in English and Spanish and an MA in English Literature from the University of Leeds.

I am the Digital Editor at the UK’s leading publisher of poetry in translation, [Arc Publications](http://arcpublications.co.uk/), after starting on a marketing and editorial internship in 2012. I was responsible for Arc’s move into digital publishing, designing and converting new and backlist titles into ebook formats. I develop new technologies and digital markets, including the poetry translation app/game Translatory on [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/translatory-translate-poetry/id1068155872) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arcpublications.translatory).

I work freelance as an ebook designer, converter and distributor for independent presses and self-published authors. I was the programming and digital design half of kids’ app team [Robin & his Birds](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1445462327/robin-and-his-birds), alongside illustrator and storyteller Louise Bell, and I recently launched [MealsUp](https://itunes.apple.com/app/mealsup/id1200169378), a new meal planning app on iOS.

I also play violin in the two-person ghost story theatre show [The Book of Darkness and Light](https://www.facebook.com/TheBookofDarknessAndLight), currently touring UK theatres.
